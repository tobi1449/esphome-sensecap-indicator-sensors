# ESPHome external component for SenseCap Indicator sensors
This is an external component for ESPHome that can read the sensor values sent from the RP2040 of a SenseCap Indicator.
The components supports reading temperature and humidity from the external AHT41 sensor, COÂ² from the internal SCD41 sensor and TVOC from the internal SGP40 sensor.

When the SenseCap Indicator's RP2040 is flashed with [tobi1449/sensecap-indicator-rp2040-extended](https://github.com/tobi1449/sensecap-indicator-rp2040-extended), this component can also read temperature and humidity from the internal SCD41 sensor and set the altitude adjustment for the SCD41.
